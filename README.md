### Homework instructions
1. Create a new project;
2. Write Verilog source files (module and testbench), description of the CCTA. Saved the Verilog description as q5_xxxxxxx.v, and q5_tb_xxxxxxx.v;
3. The specifications for this module CCTA are:
  - Inputs A, B and C are 4-bit vector inputs.
  - Output q is 5-bit wide.
  - rst is active high, when activated q is set to 0;
  - When ctrl input is ‘0’, output q is the sum of A and B.
  - When ctrl input is ‘1’, output q is the difference of A and C.
